## Compatibility

Signal is a [`Proxy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) object at its core, please check [compatibility section](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy#browser_compatibility).

## Documentation

[Functions & Types](https://jsr.io/@kaiverse/signal/doc)

## Example

[Playground source code](https://github.com/kaisergeX/signal-proxy/blob/main/packages/signal/src/playground/index.ts)

### ðŸ”—Signal Proxy

````js
/**
 * HTML setup:
 * ```html
 * <p id="fetch-result"></p>
 * <button type="button" onclick="fetchNextUser()">Get next user</button>
 * ```
 */

import {signalProxy} from '@kaiverse/signal'

const resultElement = document.getElementById('fetch-result')

const userSignal = signalProxy({userId: 123, reqCount: 0}, async (key, newValue) => {
  // Do something when any userSignal's prop value changes
  console.log(`[userSignal updated] key: ${key}, value: ${newValue}`)

  if (key === 'userId') {
    // Do something on `userId` changes only
    const userId = newValue
    const response = await fetch(`${basePath}/user/${userId}`)
    const userData = await response.json()
    const totalReqCount = userSignal.reqCount + 1
    userSignal.reqCount = totalReqCount

    if (resultElement)
      resultElement.innerHTML = `Name: ${userData.name}<br/>Total requests: ${totalReqCount}`
  }
})

function fetchNextUser() {
  userSignal.userId++
}

### ðŸš¦Signal utilities

If you have experience with SolidJS or ReactJS, you'll find these utility functions very familiar.

```js
import {createComputed, createEffect, createSignal} from '@kaiverse/signal'

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)

setInterval(() => {
  setCount((c) => c + 1) // or setCount(count() + 1)
}, 1000)

createEffect(() => {
  // log the count signal's value to the console every 1 second
  console.log('count =', count())
})

const doubled = createComputed(() => count() * 2)

createEffect(() => {
  // log the doubled signal's value to the console every 1 second
  console.log('[computed] doubled =', doubled())
})
```

## Framework ports?

This package is built for vanilla JS/TS applications.

However, below are implementations to adapt with some frameworks's reactive systems.

### React

[React signal hooks](https://github.com/kaisergeX/signal-proxy/blob/main/apps/playground/src/hooks/react-signal.ts) implementation. Lack of testing. **DO NOT** use in production.

<small>
  Those hooks work, but its lack of testing. An alternative approach may be better. Please feel free
  to open PRs. Your contributions are welcomed and appreciated.
</small>

[React playground](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/kaiverse-signal-react-port-c7sp3v) (codesandbox) - [source code](https://github.com/kaisergeX/signal-proxy/blob/main/apps/playground/src/routes/signal/route.lazy.tsx)

### React Server Components/Functions

Compatible.

### Astro

Compatible. No additional setup required.

You can use it in the [component script](https://docs.astro.build/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script) section for server signals, and/or the [`<script>`](https://docs.astro.build/guides/client-side-scripts/#using-script-in-astro) tag for client signals.

### SolidJS, VueJS

... Just use their "signal" APIs.
