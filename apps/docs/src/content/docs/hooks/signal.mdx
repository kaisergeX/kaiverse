<Aside title="Independent package" type="caution">

These hooks are separate to an independent package <a href="https://jsr.io/@kaiverse/signal-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">`@kaiverse/signal-react`</a>, and not included in this library anymore.

</Aside>

```js
import {useSignal, useSyncSignal, useSignalEffect, useComputed} from '@kaiverse/signal-react'
```

A collection of hooks that allow us to use <a href={`${BASE_URL}/utils/signal`}>`signal` features</a> inside React components.

Includes:

- `useSignal` - create a `Signal`.
- `useSyncSignal` - create a `Signal`. Integrated with `useSyncExternalStore`.
- `useSignalEffect` - register a `Signal` effect.
- `useComputed` - create a computed value from `Signal`(s).

## Installation

No need to install the core package `@kaiverse/signal` separately.

## `useSignal`

Create a `Signal` inside React component.
`useSignal` uses `useReducer` and returns a snapshot of Signal. It works better with concurrent rendering but has temporary tearing issue.

Consider using [`useSyncSignal`](#usesyncsignal) which uses `useSyncExternalStore` that solves tearing issues, but doesn't work well with concurrent rendering. It's a trade-off, choose wisely.

Read more about [the tearing issue](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/69).

## `useSyncSignal`

Create a `Signal` inside React component.
`useSyncSignal` is integrated with `useSyncExternalStore` (`uSES`) which is a recommended way to use "external stores" in React.

`useSyncSignal` works well in most cases. However, `uSES` doesn't work with concurrent rendering. `useSyncSignal`'s setter wrapped with `startTransition` won't behave as expected.
Suspend a render based on a store value returned by `uSES` will trigger the nearest `Suspense` fallback instead of showing the old UI.
Read more: [useSyncExternalStore](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20not%20recommended%20to%20suspend%20a%20render%20based%20on%20a%20store%20value%20returned%20by%20useSyncExternalStore)

[`useSignal`](#usesignal), on the other hand, doesn't use `uSES`. It returns a snapshot of Signal and uses `useReducer` to perform a re-render on Signal changes.
As a result, It works better with concurrent rendering but suffers from temporary tearing issue.

It's a trade-off after all. Choose the one that fits your use case.

## `useSignalEffect`

Signal effect inside React component. It accepts a imperative function that will run whenever dependencies change. Dependencies are Signals that are used inside the Effect itself.

`useSignalEffect` can track either global Signal(s) or local (both inside or outside component) Signal(s) or all of them together.

```tsx title="use-signal-effect-example.tsx"
import {createSignal, useSignalEffect} from '@kaiverse/signal-react'

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)

export function UseSignalEffectExample() {
  useSignalEffect(() => {
    console.log('count =', count()) // this will run whenever the increment button is clicked
  })

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>
      Increment
    </button>
  )
}
```

## `useComputed`

Derived signals inside React component.

Usually used to create a computed Signal from Signal(s) or to bind Signal(s), that created outside components, to React reactive system.

  <TabItem label="use-computed-example.tsx">

```tsx
import {useSignal, useComputed} from '@kaiverse/signal-react'
import {globalCountSignal} from './global-store'

const [globalCount, setGlobalCount] = globalCountSignal

  const sum = useComputed(() => count() + globalCount())

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
        count++
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setGlobalCount(globalCount() + 2)}>
        Increase global count
      </button>
      Result: {count()} + {globalCount()} = {sum()}
    </>
  )
